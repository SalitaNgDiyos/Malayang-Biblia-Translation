<h2><center>Ang Malayang Biblia (Bagong Tipan)</center></h2><p style="text-indent: 25px;">Ang Malayang Biblia (AMB) started in 2017 whose vision is to provide a fresh Tagalog translation of the Bible that is accessible to all Bible loving Filipinos. This translation aims to reach not just the casual reader, but also serious students of the Word who would rather use the more popular English Bibles over a Filipino translation.</p><br><p style="text-indent: 25px;">Since the first translation of the Bible in Tagalog came to the Philippine masses, the work of Bible translation has been done through the hands of individuals selected within the mainstream Protestant and Roman Catholic Denominations. The first Tagalog New Testament (NT) was released in 1902 under The American Bible Society (ABS) and British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) which made use of the Textus Receptus Greek Text. In 1905, the first full Tagalog Bible, known as Ang Biblia, was published by the Philippine Bible Society (PBS), an auxiliary of the ABS. This formal translation was based on the American Standard Version (ASV). This cycle of corporate driven Bible Translations continues to this day; however, AMB is produced in a unique way, free from denominational biases and baseless human traditions.</p><br><p style="text-indent: 25px;">Many Filipino Christians mistakenly believe the 1905 Ang Biblia is a direct Tagalog translation of the King James Version (KJV) because both use archaic language. While the KJV uses archaic English, and the 1905 Ang Biblia uses archaic Tagalog, their textual foundations are vastly different. The KJV New Testament is based on the Textus Receptus Greek text, whereas the 1905 Ang Biblia and nearly all subsequent Filipino New Testament translations have been based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novum_Testamentum_Graece" style="color:blue;">Nestle-Aland</a> Greek text. This reliance on the Nestle-Aland text has been the standard for over a century, until recently.<br><p style="text-indent: 25px;"><em>Ang Salita ng Diyos ay hindi nakakulong. - 2 Timoteo 2:9 (AMB)</em></p><br><p style="text-indent: 25px;">Ang Malayang Biblia (AMB), which translates to "The Liberated Bible," was created to challenge this convention. Its name reflects the belief that the NT Greek Text underlying most modern Bibles have been corrupted by errors introduced in the 19th century—a position championed by scholars like F. H. Scrivener and Dean Burgon (see <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/36722/pg36722-images.html" style="color:blue;">The Revision Revised</a>). True to its name, the AMB aims to free our Tagalog New Testament by returning to the Textus Receptus, providing a translation that is more faithful to the original NT manuscripts.</p><br><p style="text-indent: 25px;"><em>Dahil hindi kami tulad ng marami na nagkakamal ng salapi sa pagmamanipula ng Salita ng Diyos, kundi kami ay namumuhay ng may katapatan, at talagang ayon sa Diyos kami ay nagsasalita sa harap ng Diyos sa tulong ni Kristo. - 2 Corinto 2:17 (AMB)</em></p><br><p style="text-indent: 25px;">For the first time in modern history, we are proud to introduce a Tagalog New Testament translated directly from the Textus Receptus Greek text. With the expertise of leading linguistic and biblical scholars, along with our excellent developers, we have created a faithful and accurate New Testament for the Tagalog-speaking community.</p><br><b><h3>What's Unique about AMB?</b></h3><ol><li>This is the only Tagalog New Testament translation currently available that is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textus_Receptus" style="color:blue;">Textus Receptus</a>.</li><br><li>Every Strong's Number and Greek parsing from the source text is linked to every word or phrase in the Tagalog translation which can be shown using iBiblia for PC  <a href="https://github.com/rubiot/ibiblia" style="color:blue;">https://github.com/rubiot/ibiblia</a>. This is done for the purpose of transparency and accountability of every word or phrase.</li><br><li>AMB has an option that includes Strongs Definition and Greek parsing of every Tagalog word or phrase which can be shown using MySword <a href="https://mysword.info/" style="color:blue;">https://mysword.info/</a> for Android or theWord <a href="https://www.theword.net/" style="color:blue;">https://www.theword.net/</a> for PC.</li><br><li>Words of Jesus in <span style="color: red;">Red</span>.</li><br><li>Smoothing words not found in the Greek in italics to distinguish them from words that are in the original Greek. Smoothing words refer to words or phrases that translators strategically use to make the translated text flow more naturally and sound less like a literal, word-for-word rendering of the original. These words help to bridge ideas, clarify relationships between sentences, and enhance the overall readability of the translated text in the target language.</li><br><li>Pronouns referring to God or Christ, and common words used in spiritual terms (i.e. Ang Batas, Buhay, Kamatayan, Kongregasyon, Mensahero, etc.:) which otherwise could not be understood in their proper context, have their initial letters capitalized.</li><br><li>AMB faithfully translates into Tagalog all transliterated words found in Tagalog Bibles (except for proper names) that often hides the meaning of the word. Transliteration is the practice in translation where a word from the source text is translated to another language in such a way as to make the newly translated word sound very similar to the original word from which it was translated. Examples are: ἀπόστολος, which sounds like "apostolos", and the English transliteration is, "apostle", in Tagalog, "apostol;" but the actual Tagalog equivalent word is "mensahero." Another one is βάπτισμα (means immersion), which sounds like "baptisma", when transliterated in English is "baptism," in Tagalog, "bautismo." But to translate this faithfully in Tagalog, it should say, "lublob."</li><br><li>Just like how the Koine Greek in Biblical times was used as the language of the masses, AMB uses the same approach to its translation by making its language like the language of the common people meaning, more conversational and up to date. Some of the terms in the Filipino vocabulary that were used in other translations were updated on this translation, especially those terms that were taken from the Spanish vocabulary. Examples are: Iglesia, Obispo, and Diakono. We replaced these old words with: Konggregasyon, Tagapangasiwa, and Lingkod, respectively.</li><br><li>Units of measurements of distance, weight, volume, and money currency found in the Bible were translated to modern day equivalence using the metric system, and the Philippine peso currency, respectively. </li><br><li>AMB uses words that show respect for elders or people in authority just like what a good Filipino would do. This is done by addressing such people with the plural form instead of the singular 2nd person pronoun and adding the term "po" and "opo". Examples: "niyo" instead of "mo" or "kayo po" instead of "ikaw."</li><br><li>AMB is on Github and is available to all. Qualified translators can contribute, modify or add changes to the text as they see fit via <a href="https://github.com/SalitaNgDiyos/Malayang-Biblia-Translation" style="color:blue;">Ang Malayang Biblia Github</a>.</li><br><b><h3>Special Thanks to:</h3></b><ol><li>Costas Sergiou, for providing the world with TheWord software free of charge.</li><li>Rubio Terra, for providing the iBiblia software and building it according to translators’ needs.</li><li>Steve Sweigart, Jon Graef, Jonathan Koehn and theWord community for formatting and providing bible texts and books without which this work of translation would be virtually impossible.</li><br><p>Also check our translations workflow process found here: <a href="http://www.xmind.net/m/65GpbK" style="color:blue;">http://www.xmind.net/m/65GpbK</a><p><p>For other inquiries please contact us at <a href="mailto:malayangbiblia@gmail.com">malayangbiblia@gmail.com</a></p><p><b>Ang Malayang Biblia</b> is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/" style="color:blue;">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/</a></p><p>Permissions beyond the scope of this license may be available at <a href="mailto:malayangbiblia@gmail.com">malayangbiblia@gmail.com</a></p><p>If you are blessed with this ministry, please consider supporting us financially.
