<h2><center>Ang Malayang Biblia (Bagong Tipan)</center></h2><p style="text-indent: 25px;">Ang Malayang Biblia (AMB) started in 2017 whose vision is to provide a fresh Tagalog translation of the Bible that is accessible to all Bible loving Filipinos. This translation aims to reach not just the casual reader, but also serious students of the Word who would rather use the more popular English Bibles over a Filipino translation. Since the first translation of the Bible in Tagalog came to the Philippine masses, the work of Bible translation has been done through the hands of individuals selected within the mainstream Protestant and Roman Catholic Denominations. The first Tagalog New Testament was released in 1902 under The American Bible Society (ABS) and British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) which made use of the Textus Receptus Greek Text. In 1905, the first full Tagalog Bible, known as Ang Biblia, was published by the Philippine Bible Society (PBS), an auxiliary of the ABS. This formal translation was based on the American Standard Version (ASV). This cycle of corporate driven Bible Translations continues to this day; however, AMB is produced in a unique way, free from twisted traditions and corporate agendas.</p><br><p style="text-indent: 25px;">Most Christians in the Philippines think that the 1905 Ang Biblia was based on the King James Version due to its use of archaic Tagalog, just as the KJV uses archaic English; however, there is a huge difference, the KJV and Ang Biblia do not share the same Greek Text (Textus Receptus vs. Nestle-Aland). Since the publication of the Ang Biblia 1905, Nestle-Aland's Greek Text became the basis of all Filipino New Testament Bible Translation, until in 2017. Ang Malayang Biblia (AMB) stands for "The Bible Set Free," as if it was chained and imprisoned. True to its name, the AMB sets the Tagalog Bible free from all religious and human corruptions deeply imbedded in mainstream Bible translations (see <a href="https://ccel.org/ccel/burgon/corruption/corruption" style="color:blue;">John William Burgon</a>).</p><br><p style="text-indent: 25px;"><em>Dahil hindi kami tulad ng marami na nagkakamal ng salapi sa pagmamanipula ng Salita ng Diyos, kundi kami ay namumuhay ayon sa pagiging tapat, at talagang ayon sa Diyos kami ay nagsasalita sa harap ng Diyos sa tulong ni Kristo. - 2 Corinto 2:17</em></p></div><br>AMB Through the help of well-known linguistic, biblical scholars and excellent developers, we present to you the New Testament Tagalog Bible that is faithfully translated from the Textus Receptus Greek Text.<br><br><b><h3>What's Unique about AMB?</b></h3><ol><li>The only New Testament Tagalog Translation that is mostly based on the traditional Text, or Textus Receptus, taken from the Byzantine/Majority Text Family, which is universally used by the Church from the 2nd till the early 19th century AD, and is the NT manuscript used by the King James Bible translators in 1611. The rest of the Filipino translations rely heavily on codices Siniaticus and Vaticanus.</li><br><li>Every Strong's Number and Greek parsing from the source text is linked to every word or phrase in the Tagalog translation which can be shown using iBiblia for PC  <a href="https://github.com/rubiot/ibiblia" style="color:blue;">https://github.com/rubiot/ibiblia</a>. This is done for the purpose of transparency and accountability of every word or phrase.</li><br><li>AMB has an option that includes Strongs Definition and Greek parsing of every Tagalog word or phrase which can be shown using MySword <a href="https://mysword.info/" style="color:blue;">https://mysword.info/</a> for Android or theWord <a href="https://www.theword.net/" style="color:blue;">https://www.theword.net/</a> for PC.</li><br><li>Words of Jesus in <span style="color: red;">Red</span>.</li><br><li>Smoothing words not found in the Greek in italics to distinguish them from words that are in the original Greek. Smoothing words refer to words or phrases that translators strategically use to make the translated text flow more naturally and sound less like a literal, word-for-word rendering of the original. These words help to bridge ideas, clarify relationships between sentences, and enhance the overall readability of the translated text in the target language.</li><br><li>Pronouns referring to God or Christ, and common words used in spiritual terms (i.e. Ang Batas, Buhay, Kamatayan, Kongregasyon, Mensahero, etc.:) which otherwise could not be understood in their proper context, have their initial letters capitalized.</li><br><li>AMB faithfully translates into Tagalog all transliterated words found in Tagalog Bibles (except for proper names) that often hides the meaning of the word. Transliteration is the practice in translation where a word from the source text is translated to another language in such a way as to make the newly translated word sound very similar to the original word from which it was translated. Examples are: ἀπόστολος, which sounds like "apostolos", and the English transliteration is, "an apostle", in Tagalog, "isang apostol;" but the real Tagalog meaning is, "mensahero." Another one is βάπτισμα (means immersion), which sounds like "baptisma", when transliterated in English is "baptism," in Tagalog, "bautismo." But to translate this faithfully in Tagalog, it should say, "lublob."</li><br><li>Just like how the Koine Greek in Biblical times was used as the language of the masses, AMB uses the same approach to its translation by making its language like the language of the common people meaning, more conversational and up to date. Some of the terms in the Filipino vocabulary that were used in other translations were updated on this translation, especially those terms that were taken from the Spanish vocabulary. Examples are: Iglesia, Obispo, and Diakono. We replaced these old words with: Konggregasyon, Tagapangasiwa, and Lingkod, respectively.</li><br><li>Units of measurements of distance, weight, volume, and money currency found in the Bible were translated to modern day equivalence using the metric system, and the Philippine peso currency, respectively. </li><br><li>AMB uses words that show respect for elders or people in authority just like what a good Filipino would do. This is done by addressing such people with the plural form instead of the singular 2nd person pronoun and adding the term "po" and "opo". Examples: "niyo" instead of "mo" or "kayo po" instead of "ikaw."</li><br><li>AMB is on Github and is available to all.
